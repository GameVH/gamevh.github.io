            <p>This Privacy Policy covers how GameVH treats personal information that GameVH collects and receives
                in
                connection with your use of the games and applications offered by GameVH. This includes software
                that
                you
                have downloaded or are about to download, any software you have embedded on a website or are about
                to
                embed
                ("GameVH"), any application created by GameVH and available through social networking sites (“SNS
                Apps”),
                any application created by GameVH and available through mobile devices (“Mobile App”). Your privacy
                is
                very
                important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Services to protect
                information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we
                collect,
                use and, in certain circumstances, share your personally identifiable information. Please read this
                Privacy
                Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
                <p>By registering for, accessing, using, and/or downloading any Service, you agree to GameVH's Privacy
                    Policy and that you will abide by GameVH's Terms of Service. Among other things, you consent to the
                    collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy
                    may
                    be amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice
                    that
                    changes have been made on the website www.gamevh.net. You should visit this page periodically to
                    review
                    any changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>What we collect</h2>
            </li>
            <div class="content">
                <p>GameVH gives you a number of options regarding what information you will give us:</p>
                <p>- When you register your profile with GameVH, your profile including any information (name, address,
                    gender)
                    will be registered with GameVH. When you identify yourself on a GameVH site, you may identify
                    yourself
                    using
                    a GameVH account. When you identify yourself on a GameVH site, you may identify yourself through a
                    social
                    network account in which GameVH may receive additional information about your profile.</p>
                <p>- In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and
                    email
                    addresses provided at your discretion, we don’t generally collect any “Personally Identifying
                    Information”
                    about our users (such as social security numbers, street address, drivers license number, etc.),
                    exception
                    being for billing and payment where we store your billing information such as name, street address,
                    phone
                    number. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender,
                    age,
                    occupation, hobbies, interests, zip codes, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from
                    social
                    networking systems on which you have used GameVH Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of
                    use
                    of
                    those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>- In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in
                    other
                    content (“Content”), such as in games. Any action you perform with other players are considered
                    public,
                    and
                    at your own discretion.</p>
                <p>- When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else’s page, we
                    may
                    record
                    information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible
                    on
                    your
                    social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.</p>
                <p>- Note that since most GameVH is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and
                    accept
                    their
                    Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.</p>
                <p>- When you use a Mobile App, which includes telephones and other devices such as tablets, you agree
                    that
                    information about your use of the Service through your mobile device and carrier may be communicated
                    to
                    us.
                    This information includes, but is not limited to your carrier, device, geo-location, IP address,
                    telephone
                    number, country or other information you provide. With your permission, we may also access your
                    contacts.
                    Your carrier’s standard fees and rates will still apply, including without limitation SMS/text
                    messaging
                    fees, and you accept responsibility for all charges.</p>
                <p>- When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and
                    maintain
                    on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and
                    content.
                </p>
                <p>- We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to
                    newspapers
                    and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, GameVH Games and other users of
                    GameVH,
                    to
                    supplement your profile.</p>
                <p>- GameVH may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy
                    practices
                    of
                    other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy
                    statements
                    of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy
                    applies
                    solely to information collected by GameVH.</p>
                <p>- Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal
                    reports
                    and
                    make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including
                    information
                    about users accessing the GameVH site, playing GameVH Games, using SNS Apps on other sites or using
                    Mobile
                    Apps, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages
                    and
                    URLs,
                    other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed
                    and
                    the
                    order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity
                    Information”).</p>
                <p>- By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous
                    form as
                    long as GameVH sees fit.</p>

                    that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 we will delete
                    that

                    about
                    you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such
                    access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal
                    process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, to protect our rights and
                    property, or that of our affiliates or the public, or when there is a violation of our Terms of
                    Service

                    part
                    if GameVH determines, in its sole discretion, that such Content constitutes an infringing or a
                    prohibited posting as set forth in our Terms of Service or for any or no reason.</p>
                <p>- We also use non-Personally Identifiable Information and certain technical information about your

                    Games
                    or SNS Apps is served or hosted by other sites. These other sites maintain their own policies

                <p>- GameVH takes appropriate precautions to protect our users’ information. Your account information is
                    located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as your
                    password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more
                    about
                    SSL, go to <a

                    However, regardless of the
                    precautions
                    taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. Therefore, although we
                    work
                    very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
                    information or private communications will always remain private. We cannot ensure or warrant the
                    ultimate security of any information you transmit. Because email and instant messaging are not
                    recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email
                    or
                    instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of GameVH Web Site, please
